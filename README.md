# CINEIA

Repository for Projet de Synthèse pour M1 IISC-SIC.

## Current Status

We have multiple modules in the project directory, mainly:

- `DNN_light_TTower`
- `DNN_TorchFM_TTower`

✅ **The current focus is on the `DNN_TorchFM_TTower` module**, which implements a Two-Tower model architecture using the `torchfm` library. This is **more advanced and production-oriented** compared to the `DNN_light_TTower`.

For deeper technical details, you can refer to the individual README located in the `DNN_TorchFM_TTower` directory, which provides a **quick start** guide, training steps, and inference instructions.
